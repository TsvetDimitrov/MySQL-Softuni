# MySQL-Softuni
This repo includes all solutions for the MySQL tasks course in Softuni.
Please use judge to submit your solutions. Keep in mind that the solutions can differentiate by some given values but the core logic should be the same. Also keep in mind that judge does not accept the schema/database name before each of the queries for e.g: 
**Use** 

**ALTER TABLE `towns` 
CHANGE COLUMN `town_id` `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;**

Instead of 

**ALTER TABLE `minions`.`towns` 
CHANGE COLUMN `town_id` `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;**
